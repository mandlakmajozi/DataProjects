# Superstore Sales Analysis (Power BI)

## Business Context
Leadership wants to understand what is driving sales and profitability performance in order to identify risks, inefficiencies, and growth opportunities.

## Analytical Objectives
Power BI Imported an additional tabled called "Orders$Filters Database" which does not appear to be a business table but rather an Excel artifact.
No Null or Empty Values were observed in the three tables. (Orders, People Returns).
Order Date and Ship Dates are correctly identified as date fields.
The Orders Table each row represents a single item within an order.
Customer, product, location, and sales information are all stored together, which makes analysis harder without restructuring.
